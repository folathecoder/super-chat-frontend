This example will cover a fictional topic: \"Building a Simple REST API with Flask.\"\n\n---\n\n# Building a Simple REST API with Flask\n\nFlask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It is easy to use and great for building RESTful APIs. This guide will walk you through creating a simple REST API using Flask.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed:\n\n- Python 3.x\n- pip (Python package installer)\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\n### 1. Install Flask\n\nYou can install Flask using pip. Open your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\npip install Flask\n```\n\n### 2. Set Up Your Project Structure\n\nCreate a directory for your project:\n\n```bash\nmkdir flask_api\ncd flask_api\n```\n\nInside this directory, create a file named `app.py`.\n\n### 3. Create a Simple API\n\nEdit `app.py` to include the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Sample data\ntasks = [\n    {\n        'id': 1,\n        'title': 'Learn Flask',\n        'done': False\n    },\n    {\n        'id': 2,\n        'title': 'Build an API',\n        'done': False\n    }\n]\n\n@app.route('/tasks', methods=['GET'])\ndef get_tasks():\n    return jsonify({'tasks': tasks})\n\n@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['GET'])\ndef get_task(task_id):\n    task = next((task for task in tasks if task['id'] == task_id), None)\n    return jsonify({'task': task}) if task else ('Not Found', 404)\n\n@app.route('/tasks', methods=['POST'])\ndef create_task():\n    new_task = request.json\n    tasks.append(new_task)\n    return jsonify(new_task), 201\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### 4. Run the API\n\nTo run your Flask API, execute the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython app.py\n```\n\n### 5. Test Your API\n\nYou can test your API using tools like Postman or curl. Here’s how to use curl:\n\n- **Get All Tasks**:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks\n```\n\n- **Get a Specific Task**:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks/1\n```\n\n- **Create a New Task**:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"id\": 3, \"title\": \"Test API\", \"done\": false}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks\n```\n\n### 6. Expected Output\n\nWhen you call the endpoint to get all tasks, you should receive a JSON response like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": 1,\n            \"title\": \"Learn Flask\",\n            \"done\": false\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 2,\n            \"title\": \"Build an API\",\n            \"done\": false\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### 7. Error Handling\n\nYou can enhance your API by adding error handling. For example, if a task is not found, you can return a custom error message:\n\n```python\n@app.errorhandler(404)\ndef not_found(error):\n    return jsonify({'error': 'Not found'}), 404\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou have successfully built a simple REST API using Flask! From here, you can expand your API by adding more endpoints, integrating a database, or implementing authentication.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)\n- [RESTful API Design](https://restfulapi.net/)\n\n---\n\nThis example includes various text structures such as headings, code snippets, lists, and tables, providing a comprehensive and organized response that is easy to follow.
